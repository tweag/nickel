# Type vs contract: when to?

You are writing Nickel code and wonder how it should be annotated. Leave it
alone? Add type annotations? Use contracts? Here is a quick guide when you don't
know what to do!

What is the nature of the expression you are considering?

## A function

Most of the time, you should use **type annotations** for functions. For
reusable code, typing is often more adapted than contracts. You can
exceptionally use contracts when types are not expressive enough to encode the
property you want (such as in `ValidUrl -> Port -> ValidUrl`) or if the type
system is not powerful enough to see that your code is correct.

What to do depends on the context:

- *Anonymous function: nothing*. Short, anonymous functions can
    usually live without annotation. Inside a typed block, they will be
    typechecked anyway. Outside, anonymous function can't be reused elsewhere,
    and are generally short functions passed as arguments to typed higher-order
    functions, which will apply a guarding contract.

    Example: `std.array.map (fun x => x + 1) [1,2,3]`
- *Let-bound function outside of typed block: use a type annotation.* Even if
    local to a file, if your function is bound to a variable, it can be
    potentially reused in different places.

    Example: `let append_tm: String -> String = fun s => s ++ "(TM)" in ...`
- *Let-bound function inside a typed block: nothing or type annotation*. Inside a
    typed block, types are inferred, so it is OK for simple functions to not be
    annotated. However, you are required to annotate it if it is polymorphic,
    because the typechecker won't infer polymorphic types for you. When the
    function type is non trivial, it can also be better to write an annotation
    for the sake of clarity.

    Example:

    ```nickel
    let foo : Number =
      let addTwo = fun x => x + 2 in
      addTwo 4
    in ...

    let foo : Number =
      let ev : ((Number -> Number) -> Number) -> Number -> Number
        = fun f x => f (std.function.const x) in
      ev (fun f => f 0) 1
    in ...
    ```

## Data (record, array)

Conversely, for data inside configuration code, you should use **contracts**.
Types are not adding much for configuration data, while contracts are more
flexible and expressive.

Example:

```nickel
let Schema = {
  name | String
       | doc "Name of the package",
  version | PkgVersion
          | doc "The semantic version of the package",
          | default = "1.0.0",
  build | Array BuildSteps
        | doc "The steps to perform in order to build the package",
        | default = [],
} in
{
  name = "hello",
  build = [
    command "gcc hello.c -o hello",
    command "mv hello $out"
  ],
} | Schema
```

## Computation (compound expressions)

Some expressions are neither immediate data nor functions. Take for example the
function application `std.array.map (fun s => "http://%{s}/index") servers`.
Usually, you should do **nothing**.

- *Inside configuration: nothing*. The function or operator you are using should
  be typed, and thus protected by a contract. The final value should also be
  protected by a contract, as per the advice on configuration code. Thus, for a
  simple computation like the example above, it is not necessary to add an
  annotation.
- *Inside typed block: nothing*. Inside a typed block, the application will be
  inferred and typechecked, so you shouldn't have to add anything.

## Debugging

At last, both type annotations and contracts come in handy for debugging. In
this case, you don't have to follow the previous advices, and you can drop
random annotations or contract applications pretty much everywhere you see fit.
