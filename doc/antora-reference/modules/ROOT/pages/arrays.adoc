= Arrays

An array is a sequence of values. Arrays are delimited by square brackets (`[` and `]`), and
their elements are separated by commas (`,`). There can be an optional trailing comma
after the last element.

```nickel
[1, 2, 3]
["Hello", "World"]
[1, true, "true",]
[]
```

== Built-in array operators

Nickel has a single built-in binary array operator: `@` concatenates arrays.

```nickel #repl
> [1] @ [2, 3]
[ 1, 2, 3 ]
```
