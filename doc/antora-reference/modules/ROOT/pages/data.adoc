= Representing data

Nickel's basic data types are xref:numbers.adoc[numbers],
xref:booleans.adoc[booleans], xref:strings.adoc[strings],
xref:arrays.adoc[arrays], and xref:records.adoc[records].
All of these basic data types can be written to and read from
the analogous types in JSON, YAML, and TOML.

TODO: link to serialization

Nickel also supports data-bearing xref:enums.adoc[enums],
also known as "tagged unions" or "sum types". These can
be used for programming in Nickel, but are not interoperable
with JSON, YAML, or TOML.
