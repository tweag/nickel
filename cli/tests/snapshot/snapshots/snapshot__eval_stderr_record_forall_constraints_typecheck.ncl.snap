  = Found an expression with the row `x : _a`
  = But this row appears inside another record type, which already has a diffent declaration for the field `x`
  = A type cannot have two conflicting declarations for the same row

note: while matching types
 = Expected type { ; r }
 = With inferred type { x : _a }
