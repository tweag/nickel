  = Found an expression with the row `'Foo _a`
  = But this row appears inside another enum type, which already has a diffent declaration for the tag `Foo`
  = A type cannot have two conflicting declarations for the same row

note: while matching types
 = Expected type [| ; r |]
 = With inferred type [| 'Foo _a; _erows_b |]
