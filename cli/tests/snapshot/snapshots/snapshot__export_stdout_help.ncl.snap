Customize a Nickel configuration through the command line

Usage: customize-mode [OPTIONS] [FIELD_PATH=NICKEL_EXPRESSION]... [COMMAND]

Commands:
  list  List the input fields and the overridable fields of the configuration
  help  Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Arguments:
  [FIELD_PATH=NICKEL_EXPRESSION]...
          Assign a valid Nickel expression to an input field of the configuration. The new value
          will be merged with the configuration with priority 0 (the one assigned by default in
          Nickel when no explicit merge priority is provided).
          
          Assignment can only set input fields, that is fields without definition or fields with a
          default value. To override an existing value, use `--override` instead.
          
          Note that you might have to escape special characters or enclose assignments in quotes to
          prevent shell interpretation.
          
          Example: `nickel eval config.ncl -- 'http.enabled="yes"' protocol=\'ftp`

Options:
      --override <FIELD_PATH=NICKEL_EXPRESSION>
          Override any field of the configuration with a valid Nickel expression. The new value will
          be merged with the configuration with a `force` priority.
          
          Note that you might have to escape special characters or enclose assignments in quotes to
          prevent shell interpretation.
          
          Example: `-- input.value=false --override m.count=2 --override m.type=\'server`

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

WARNING: Customize mode is experimental. Its interface is subject to breaking changes.
