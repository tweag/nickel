note: when parsing a field path on the command line
 = A field path must be a dot-separated list of fields. Special characters must be properly escaped, both for Nickel and for the shell.
 = For example: a field path `config."$port"` in Nickel source code must be written `config.\"\$port\"` or `'config."$port"'` on a POSIX shell
