/// a git repo, or should they always need to be at the root? Currently we only
/// allow them at the root, the motivation being that if the git repo backing
/// the index package only contains the package itself, then it will be a
/// smaller download. On the other hand, we allow git dependencies to live in
/// a subdirectory, the idea being that you can have a monorepo with multiple
/// Nickel packages.
///
/// Maybe the current situation is already flexible enough, as the publishing
/// workflow could have an automatic step to extract a Nickel package into its
/// own git repo.
