//! Closurization of terms.
//!
//! During evaluation, variable substitution is done lazily through the help of
//! [the environment][crate::eval::Environment]. In consequence, the complete data required to
//! evaluate an expression further isn't only the expression itself (the term), but the current
//! environment as well. [crate::eval::Closure] is precisely a tuple of a term together with its
//! environment.
//!
//! We often need to store a closure back into a term (without relying on the environment):
//! typically, when we combine several operands (think merging or array concatenation), each with
//! its own environment. This is what we call closurization: wrap a closure back as a term. By
//! extension, several structures containing term can be closurized as well, wich means to
//! closurize all the inner terms.
