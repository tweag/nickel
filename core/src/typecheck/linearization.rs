//! Linearization interface and Empty implementation
//!
//! The linearization module mainly serves to assist the LSP.
//!
//! **Like the LSP crate, this part of nickel is currently **under heavy development**
//! and may change unadvertedly.**
//!
//! At this point it is integrated into the typechecking allowing to trace an AST
//! into a linear representation. This representation, being separate from the
//! AST can include additional meta information about types, references, and
//! possibly more in the future.
//!
//! # Components
//!
//! - [Linearizer]: Implements functionality to record terms (integrated into typechecking)
//!                 into a temporary [Linearizer::Building] structure and linearize them into a
//!                 [Linearizer::Completed] Linearization.
//!                 Additionally handles registration in different scopes.
//! - [StubHost]: The purpose of this is to do nothing. It serves as an implementation used
//!               outside the LSP context meaning to cause as little runtime impact as possible.
