    /// Recall that when a call `f arg` is evaluated, the following events happen:
    /// 1. `arg` is pushed on the evaluation stack.
    /// 2. `f` is evaluated.

    ///    from the stack, bound to `id` in the environment, and `body is entered`.
    ///
    /// For error reporting purpose, we want to be able to determine the chain of nested calls
    /// leading to the current code path at any moment. To do so, the Nickel abstract machine
    /// maintains a callstack via this basic mechanism:
    /// 1. When an application is evaluated, push a marker with the position of the application on
    ///    the callstack.
    /// 2. When a function body is entered, push a marker with the position of the original
    ///    application on the callstack.
    /// 3. When a variable is evaluated, push a marker with its name and position on the callstack.
    /// 4. When a record field is accessed, push a marker with its name and position on the
    ///    callstack too.
    ///
    /// Both field and variable are useful to determine the name of a called function, when there is
    /// one.  The resulting stack is not suited to be reported to the user for the following
    /// reasons:
    ///
    /// 1. One call spans several items on the callstack. First the application is entered (pushing
    ///    an `App`), then possibly variables or other application are evaluated until we eventually
    ///    reach a function for the left hand side. Then body of this function is entered (pushing a
    ///    `Fun`).
    /// 2. Because of currying, multi-ary applications span several objects on the callstack.
    ///    Typically, `(fun x y => x + y) arg1 arg2` spans two `App` and two `Fun` elements in the
    ///    form `App1 App2 Fun2 Fun1`, where the position span of `App1` includes the position span
    ///    of `App2`.  We want to group them as one call.
    /// 3. The callstack includes calls to builtin contracts. These calls are inserted implicitly by
    ///    the abstract machine and are not written explicitly by the user. Showing them is
    ///    confusing and clutters the call chain, so we get rid of them too.
    ///
    /// This is the role of `group_by_calls`, which filter out unwanted elements and groups
    /// callstack elements into atomic call elements represented by [`CallDescr`].
    ///
    /// The final call description list is reversed such that the most nested calls, which are
    /// usually the most relevant to understand the error, are printed first.
