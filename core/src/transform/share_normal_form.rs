//! Share normal form.
//!
//! Replace the subexpressions of WHNFs that are not functions by indices, such that they can be
//! shared. It is similar to the behavior of other lazy languages with respect to data
//! constructors.  To do so, subexpressions are replaced by fresh variables, introduced by new let
//! bindings put at the beginning of the WHNF.
//!
//! For example, take the expression:
//! ```text
//! let x = {a = 1 + 1} in x.a + x.a
//! ```
//!
//! The term `{a = 1 + 1}` is a record, and hence a WHNF. In consequence, the index pointing to x
//! is never updated. Without additional machinery, `a` will be recomputed each time is it used,
//! two times here.
//!
//! The transformation replaces such subexpressions, namely the content of the fields
//! of records and the elements of arrays - `(1 + 1)` in our example -, with fresh variables
//! introduced by `let`  added at the head of the term:
//!
//! ```text
//! let x = (let var = 1 + 1 in {a = var}) in x.a + x.a
//! ```
//!
//! Now, the field `a` points to the element introduced by `var`: at the evaluation of the first
//! occurrence of `x.a`, this element is updated with `2`, and is not recomputed the second time.
//!
//! Newly introduced variables begin with a special character to avoid clashing with user-defined
//! variables.
