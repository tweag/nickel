# pattern matching on pure enum is special-cased for performance reasons, using
# a hashmap. The presence of a wildcard pattern has to be handled differently
# that for normal match expressions, which are just testing all patterns in
# order.
#
# This test ensure it correctly handle a wildcard being used before the end of
# the match expression, which was mishandled previously (branches after the
# wildcard would be selected if they matched).
