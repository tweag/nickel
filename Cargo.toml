# The wasm-bindgen version is pinned using `=` since flake.nix reads the version
# number from Cargo.lock and needs to have matching output hashes for the source
# derivation. Combined with caching this would leed to silent inconsistent builds
# if this version changes without the nix output hashes being updated. It's okay
# to bump the version (for example if not doing so prevents some dependency from
# building) but flake.nix needs to be kept in sync.
