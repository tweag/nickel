# This is the part of the benchmark runner that runs on pull requests.
# It's separate from the master runner for two reasons:
# - to track it differently on bencher.dev, because we only want to use master as
#   the historical baseline for comparison
# - because it might want to run on PRs from forks, and those don't get access to the
#   bencher API key.
#
# See the [bencher docs] for more details.
