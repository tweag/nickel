# Polymorphic Sealing and Contract Propagation

This draft note was written in the aftermath of us discovering an issue
involving the interaction of lazy record contracts, recursive records, and
polymorphic sealing (#1161, #1228).

Nickel implements dynamic contract checks for polymorphic types by using
a sealing discipline. When converting a static type into a contract, upon
encountering a universal quantification like `forall a. ...`, Nickel maps `a` to
a sealing key. Then, the contract checking `a` in positive position becomes an
application of the `%unseal%` primop with the respective sealing key, while the
contract checking `a` in negative position becomes an application of `%seal%`.
For the contract check to ultimately succeed, evaluation must proceed in such a
way that `%unseal%` ends up only being applied to a term sealed by `%seal%` with
matching sealing keys. This means that `%seal%` and `%unseal%` must always end
up being paired one to one in program being evaluated. However, `%seal%` and
`%unseal%` are generated in different places.

If a contract containing an as yet unpaired `%seal%` or `%unseal%` ends up being
attached to a record field, any reference to this field will have to apply the
contract and essentially duplicates the `%seal%` or `%unseal%` operation. This
means that if a type containing a free type variable is turned into a contract,
and this contract gets attached to a record field for some reason, any reference
to the field has the potential to produce a mismatch between `%seal%` and
`%unseal%` primops in the program.

In #1161 this was caused by an application of `std.record.map` whose type is
given in the standard library as `forall a b. (a -> b) -> { _: a } -> { _: b }`:

```console
nickel> std.record.map (std.function.const std.function.id) { foo = 1 }
{ foo = 1 }
nickel> std.record.map (std.function.const std.function.id) { foo = 1, bar = foo }
error: contract broken by a function
```

In the first program, the contract corresponding to the type of `std.record.map`
first attaches a sealing primop to the field `foo`, then evaluates the record
to weak head normal form, and afterwards attaches an unsealing contract to the
field. Since the field is only accessed once, sealing and unsealing is paired up
and everything works fine. In the second program, sealing is applied in the same
way. But the recursive reference to `foo` in the definition of `bar` means that
the sealing contract attached to `foo` is applied when the reference to `foo`
is evaluated. This additional sealing cannot be "canceled" by the unsealing
contract which is applied in the end.

To fix #1161 we originally proposed to treat a recursive reference to a record
field that's guarded by a contract containing a free type variable as a function
application. As such, the reference would need to generate the corresponding
sealing or unsealing primop. This would act, for example, as if there were an
application of the contract for `a -> Dyn` if the field had been assigned the
contract `a`. We implemented this approach in #1194 by essentially applying all
record field contracts that contain a free type variable twice. This fixes the
issue with recursive references first reported in #1161. However, it turns out
this approach was not enough to solve the problem in its entirety, as reported
in #1228.

We ended up circumventing the problem in #1271 by making type annotations not
"stick" to record fields at all. Instead, at runtime, they now produce a one
time contract check. Since static type annotations are the only things that can
introduce type variables which require sealing and unsealing at runtime, this
prevents the root cause of the problem that initiated this note. The sealing and
unsealing primops can no longer be duplicated arbitrarily by getting attached to
record fields and recursive references.

We're keeping this draft note around to keep a record of our work debugging
the issue.

## Playgroud

```
{ foo = 1, bar = foo + 1} |> record.map (fun _key => (+) 1)
```

- type: forall a b. (String -> a -> b) -> {_: a} -> {_: b}

Evaluation of the type to a contract:

- `forall a`: insert `(a <= $forall_var true 0, ..)`
- `forall b`: insert `(b <= $forall_var true 1, ..)`

First argument type : `(String -> a -> b)` transformed to `String -> unseal 0 ->
seal 1`.

`{_: a} ~> {foo | seal 0, bar | seal 0}`
`{_: b} ~> {foo | unseal 1, bar | unseal 1}`

Record rewritten to (after dictionary contract application, before mapping):

`{ foo | seal 0 = 1, bar | seal 0 = foo + 1}`

(but in fact, we probably need `{ foo | !a = 1, bar | !a = foo + 1}`)

Then evaluated to the fixpoint (normal record):
`RECORD{ foo = 1 |> seal 0, bar = (1 |> seal 0) + 1 |> seal 0}`

Final result:

```nickel
{
  foo =
  (1 |> seal 0)
  |> unseal 0
  |> f "foo"
  |> seal 1
# second contract
  |> unseal 1

  bar
  bar =
  (1 |> seal 0) + 1 |> seal 0
  |> unseal 0
  |> f "bar"
  |> seal 1
# second contract
  |> unseal 1
}
```

Run of a `%record_map% { foo | Num =  1, bar | PosNat | Even = foo + 1} (fun _key ((+) 1)`

```
App(Op1(record_map, record), function)
Op1(record_map, record); {stack..}
record ~ RecRecord {..}

RECORD{ foo |pending Num = %1, bar |pending [PosNat,Even] = %2}
%2 := (%apply_contract% Num label %1) + 1

RECORD{ foo = f (%apply_contract% Num %1), bar = f (%apply_contract% PosNat,Even %2) }

# With a call to pending_contract.dualize()

# â€¢ type: forall a b. (String -> a -> b) -> {_: a} -> {_: b}
# forall. a (a <= $forall_var true 0, ..)
# forall. b (b <= $forall_var true 1, ..)
#
# String -> unseal 0 -> seal 1)
# : (String -> a -> b)
#
# : {_: a}
# : ~> {foo | seal 0, bar | seal 0}
#
# : {_: b}
# : ~> {foo | unseal 1, bar | unseal 1}
#

{ foo | (seal 0, a, ..data_abouta) = 1, bar | (seal 0, a, ..data_abouta) = foo + 1}

(a -> Dyn)
RECORD{ foo = 1 |> seal 0, bar = (1 |> seal 0 |> a.dualize()) + 1 |> seal 0}

Contract
|> Contract.dualize()

{
  foo =
  (1 |> seal 0)
  |> unseal 0
  |> f "foo"
  |> seal 1
# second contract
  |> unseal 1

  bar
  bar =
  (1 |> seal 0) + 1 |> seal 0
  |> unseal 0
  |> f "bar"
  |> seal 1
# second contract
  |> unseal 1
}
```

## Composition law for contracts

**Goal**: forall T "type closure", M a term in weak head normal form,
`M | T | T.dualize() = M | T'`.
Put differently, with `.` being contract composition: `T.dualize() . T ~ T'`

**Subgoals**:
  - `T.dualize().dualize() ~ T`
  - `(Foo -> Bar)' ~ Foo.dualize()' -> Bar'`

where:
- `.` is contract composition, defined as `M | (T' . T) ~ M | T | T'`
- A type closure is a type `T` with potential free variables together with a
  environment mapping free variable identifiers to a polarity (positive or
  negative) and an uid integer such that distinct variables have distinct
  identifiers. All free variables of `T` must mapped by the environment.
- T' is T where free type variables occurrences (e.g. `a`) have been replaced
  with `flip_compose(a, forall_pol, sym, current_pol)` (see below for the
  definition of `flip_compose`)
- `T.dualize` is defined as the domain contract in `T -> Dyn`.
- contracts are assumed to be idempotent
- `flip_compose(a, forall_pol, sym, current_pol)`:
  - if `forall_pol` and `current_pol` are equal, then gives
    `%seal% sym (%unseal% sym <.>)`
  - if `forall_pol` and `current_pol` aren't equal, then gives
    `%unseal% sym (%seal% sym <.>) ~ id`

## Proof

We proceed by structural induction of types.

- If `T` is a base type or a flat type, there is nothing to do, because
  `T.dualize() = T` and contracts are idempotent.

- If `T = a`, and if `forall_pol` is positive, then `<.> | T` is
  `%unseal% sym <.>`, where `(forall_pol, sym) = Tenv(a)`. Then `T.dualize()` is
  `%seal% sym <.>`, and `T.dualize() . T = %seal% sym (%unseal% sym <.>)`.
  QED.

  If `forall_pol` is `negative`, then `T.dualize()` is `%unseal% sym <.>`, and
  `U := T.dualize() . T = %unseal% sym (%seal% sym <.>) ~ id`. QED.

- If `T = Dom -> Codom`, then `T.dualize()` is the domain contract of
  `(Dom -> Codom) -> Dyn`. The domain contract of `(Dom -> Codom) -> Dyn` is the
  same as the contract of `Dom -> Codom` with polarity flipped. It's given by
  ```text
    fun x => Codom.dualize() (<.> (Dom.dualize().dualize() x))
  ~ fun x => Codom.dualize() (<.> (Dom x))
  ```
  because `dualize()` is an involution.

  Then

  ```text
  T.dualize() . T ~ fun x => Codom.dualize() ((<.> | T) (Dom x))
  T.dualize() . T ~ fun x => Codom.dualize() ((fun y => Codom (<.> (Dom.dualize() y))) (Dom x))
  ```

  Applying beta reduction:
  `fun x => Codom.dualize() (Codom (<.> (Dom.dualize() (Dom x))))`

  If we suppose that `DomDual.dualize() = Dom` and dualize is an involution,
  then by structural induction `Dom.dualize() . Dom ~ Dom'` and
  `Codom.dualize() . Codom ~ Codom'`, giving:

  ```text
  T.dualize() . T ~ fun x => Codom' (<.> (Dom' x))
  ```

  TODO:
  We need to prove that `T' ~ Dom'.dualize() -> Codom'`. Left for a later goals, add
  to subgoals.
