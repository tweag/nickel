Version 1.9 (2024-11-12)
========================

Nickel 1.9 includes various bug fixes and quality of life improvements.

Noteworthy additions are:

- let-blocks: declaring several variables at once instead of chaining
  `let ... in ...`
- explicit import: the ability to specify explicitly the format of an imported
  file (it was based on the file extension implicitly and would default
  to Nickel), e.g. as `import "foo.txt" as 'Json` or `import "bar.ncl" as
  'Text`.
- the addition of a `nickel test` command that can extract snippets from the
  in-code documentation (the `| doc` metadata) together with their expected
  result and run them. The feature is detailed in a new CLI chapter of the user
  manual.

Two important future evolutions have been designed and discussed through RFCs:
package management and a performant bytecode virtual machine. Those features
aren't implemented yet, but the initial designs have been agreed upon.

Breaking changes
----------------

* Formatting: the formatting of let bindings has been fixed and improved. To
  avoid a large, irrelevant diff on your next commits, we advise formatting your
  whole codebase first after upgrading to 1.9 in a separate commit.

Version 1.8 (2024-09-09)
========================

After a summer break, the team is happy to release Nickel 1.8!

This release ships with an important rework of the contract system, and in
particular the interface of custom contracts. The new system is more intuitive
for users implementing their own contracts, and makes it possible to use a
limited form of boolean logic on contracts that have been added to the stdlib
(`std.contract.one_of`, `std.contract.all_of`, `std.contract.not`,
`std.contract.check`).

We advise reading the updated manual section on writing custom contracts and to
migrate your custom contracts to take advantage of the simplification of the
interface and those new operators. A lot of custom contract can most likely be
implemented as validators (see `std.contract.from_validator`).

The contract system rework is backward compatible and existing custom contracts
will continue to work as before. Though in the future, Nickel will probably emit
a warning of deprecation when a custom contract is defined as a naked function
instead of using one of the new contract constructor.

A limited form of subtyping has been added in 1.8 as well, making it easier to
use records as dictionaries in statically typed code. A new paragraph has been
added to the typing chapter of the manual accordingly.

Breaking changes
----------------

* Formatting: to better accommodate the new contract system, the formatting of
    function applications and definitions have been changed. To avoid a large,
    irrelevant diff on your next commits, we advise formatting your whole
    codebase first after upgrading to 1.8 in a separate commit.

Version 1.7 (2024-06-11)
========================

Nickel 1.7 ships with several extensions to pattern matching which was
introduced in Nickel 1.5 but had a number of limitations. See below for further details.

Additionally, the publication of [Topiary](https://topiary.tweag.io/) to the
crates registry makes it so that all versions of Nickel from 1.7 and onward,
however they are built, ship with `nickel format` and the language server
formatting command working out of the box without needing a separate
installation of Topiary (which was previously required when installing from
crates.io using `cargo install nickel-lang-cli` or `cargo install
nickel-lang-lsp`).

Breaking changes
----------------

* Although primitive operators are internal and aren't officially part of any
    stability guarantee, some libraries sometimes need to resort to using them,
    when there's no equivalent in the stdlib. Nickel 1.7 had a big primop
    refactoring, amounting mostly to renaming. If you're using primops, please
    look at the corresponding [pull
    request](https://github.com/tweag/nickel/pull/1937)
* The behavior of destructuring has been changed to match exactly the behavior
    of pattern matching. While there should be no difference on well-behaving
    programs, this change makes destructuring stricter and can lead to some
    programs that were running fine before 1.7 to now fail with `unmatched
    pattern`. The typical example is when destructuring a record with a field
    that is not present: `let {x,y, ..} = import "lib.ncl" in`. If `x` is absent
    from the `lib.ncl` but is never used anywhere, this used to work fine before
    1.7 (the error would only trigger upon usage of `x`) but will now fail eagerly.

    If you need to fix a large codebase with long import destructuring chains
    and you don't know which fields are the offending ones, one possible
    technique is to open the importing file in an editor and use the `goto
    definition` command of the NLS on each field of a faulty
    pattern. If it works, the field is present, but if it doesn't, the field
    might be faulty.

Core language
-------------

* Patterns now support constant values (`1`, `null`, `"a"`, etc.), array
    patterns (`[fst, snd, ..tail]`), pattern guards (`'Foo x if std.is_number
    x`), wildcard patterns (`_` placeholder) and or-patterns (`('Foo x) or ('Bar
    x) or ('Baz x)`): (see the syntax section on of the manual for more details)

Version 1.5 (2024-03-12)
========================

Nickel 1.5 is a major release (albeit not literally), with new core language
features and improved LSP. In particular, Nickel 1.5 introduces:

- Full blown pattern matching. Patterns were previously restricted to
    destructuring let-bindings. They can now be used within match expressions as
    well (which only supported simple enum tags before).
- Enum variants. Enum variants are a new language constructs which are
    enum tags with associated data (they are applied to an argument). They can
    be seen as form of algebraic data types (ADT). Patterns, enum types,
    typechecking and other parts of the language are extended accordingly to
    support them.
- Background evaluation in the LSP. The LSP now performs evaluation of the
    current document in the background to report evaluation errors directly in
    your editor, and in particular contract errors.
- A new section of the manual on writing modular configurations.

Version 1.4
===========

Nickel 1.4 is a maintenance release, at the exception of a breaking change (see below).

Breaking changes
----------------

* The curried dot operator added in Nickel 1.3 was implemented the wrong way:
    the arguments were flipped, meaning that `(.) foo bar` was `bar."%{foo}"`
    instead of the expected `foo."%{bar}"`. While the initial flipped
    implementation seems more useful for piping operations using the reverse
    application operator `|>`, it's inconsistent with all other curried
    operators, where `(<operator>)` is always defined as `fun x y => x
    <operator> y`. To ensure consistency, and because the initial behavior was
    an oversight and not a conscious design decision, we decided to change the
    definition of `(.)` to match the other curried operator by flipping its
    arguments.

    To fill the gap, Nickel 1.4 introduces `std.record.get` with the same
    definition as the `(.)` introduced in Nickel 1.3. To migrate from 1.3 to
    1.4, you can either flip the arguments of the curried dot as a function
    `(.)` whenever possible, or you can just replace it with the new
    `std.record.get`.

    (implemented by @yannham in https://github.com/tweag/nickel/pull/1752)

* Update Topiary dependencies to correctly handle `(.)` in `nickel format` by @yannham in https://github.com/tweag/nickel/pull/1753

Version 1.3
===========

Version 1.3 includes several new optimizations following reports of long
evaluation time for medium-sized codebase. The command-line interface (CLI) has
been reworked to be more user-friendly, at the cost of breaking changes: see
below. Finally, the LSP has seen continuous improvement as well.

Breaking changes
----------------

* @vkleen improved the CLI UX in numerous ways in https://github.com/tweag/nickel/pull/1632
  - The file argument is now argument positional. That is, instead of running
    `nickel export -f config.ncl`, now use `nickel export config.ncl` instead.
  - Every command which can take a file argument can now take several of them.
    The program parsed from the files are then merged before applying the
    action. For example, the new
    `nickel export config1.ncl config2.ncl config3.ncl` is the equivalent of the
    previous:
    `nickel export <<< '(import "config1.ncl") & (import "config2.ncl") & (import "config3.ncl")'`
  - Evaluation is now an explicit subcommand, instead of being the default
    action. Instead of running `nickel -f config.ncl` to evaluate a file, use
    `nickel eval config.ncl` instead.
* Not a breaking change per se, because the customize mode is experimental, but
  @yannham introduced a new syntax for customize mode in
  https://github.com/tweag/nickel/pull/1709. Instead of dynamically generating a
  CLI where arguments are field paths, the new customize mode CLI directly take
  assignments written in a Nickel-like syntax as positional arguments. For
  example, in 1.2, the command
  `nickel eval -f confing.ncl -- \
    --input.field1 '"Value"' --input.flag false \
    --override output.bar 0`
  now becomes
  `nickel eval config.ncl -- \
    'input.field1="Value"' input.flag=false \
    --override output.bar=0`

Fixes
-----

* Fix `record.update` by making `record.insert` act consistently by @yannham in https://github.com/tweag/nickel/pull/1669

Version 1.0
===========

This is the 1.0 release! The syntax and the semantics of the core language have
been stabilized and shouldn't evolve as much in the future.

- The core semantics of the language have been reworked and stabilized, in
  particular (but not limited to) merging, types and contracts with the
  implementation of RFC005
- The stdlib has been augmented with many new functions
- Parts of the syntax and some builtin symobls (types, stdlib functions, and so
  on) have been improved and made consistent
- New features for the LSP, and in particular code completion

Breaking changes
----------------

- Various functions from the stdlib have been renamed for better discoverability,
    and the stdlib got a lot of new additions. Please refer to the documentation
    of the stdlib.
- String functions are now unicode-aware, and operate on the Unicode grapheme
    cluster abstraction instead of the character abstraction (`string.length`,
    `string.is_match`, etc.)
- The `switch` keyword has been replaced by `match`, and can now be used as a
    standalone function (doesn't need to be applied right away)
- The `Num` and `Str` builtin types have been renamed to `Number` and `String` by @yannham in https://github.com/tweag/nickel/pull/1164
- The `num` and `str` stdlib modules have been renamed to `number` and `string`
- The `builtin.typeof` function now returns `'Number`, `'String`, `'Function`
  instead of respectively `'Num`, `'Str`, and `'Fun`
- The `builtin.is_num`, `builtin.is_str` and `builtin.to_str` functions have been
  renamed to `is_number`, `is_string` and `to_string`
- The `string.to_num` and `string.from_num` functions have been renamed to
  `to_number` and `from_number`
- All the stdlib modules `array`, `string`, `record`, etc. have been put
    under a `std` namespace. They must now be accessed as `std.array`,
    `std.string` and so on.
- RFC005 was implemented, which changes the semantics of contract annotations
    and merging. See [the RFC
    content](https://github.com/tweag/nickel/blob/master/rfcs/005-metadata-rework.md)
    for more details. Most notably, metadata annotation (default values,
    `optional`, documentation, etc.) can only appear next to a record field.
    Contract and type annotations can still appear anywhere. Documentation can
    still appear on let-bindings.
- Use static dictionary types for `record.fields` and `record.values` by @matthew-healy in https://github.com/tweag/nickel/pull/1024
- Make type annotations to not propagate through merging by @yannham in https://github.com/tweag/nickel/pull/1271
- Change to dictionary contracts and introduction of a separate dictionary contract (in addition to dictionary type):
  - Fix dictionary contract semantics by @vkleen in https://github.com/tweag/nickel/pull/1141
  - Introduce dictionary contracts by @yannham in https://github.com/tweag/nickel/pull/1272
- Stdlib `string.Stringingable` -> `string.Stringable` by @vkleen in https://github.com/tweag/nickel/pull/1180
- Fix the type of `array.elem` by @yannham in https://github.com/tweag/nickel/pull/1223
- Change the enum tag start delimiter from backtick to single-quote by @vkleen in https://github.com/tweag/nickel/pull/1279
- `import` is now a statement, `import "foo.ncl" arg1 arg2` requires parenthesis now: `(import "foo.ncl") arg1 arg2`, see https://github.com/tweag/nickel/pull/1293

- Array slices by @fuzzypixelz in https://github.com/tweag/nickel/pull/776
- String interning for identifiers by @Acaccia in https://github.com/tweag/nickel/pull/835

Version 0.2  (2022-07-29)
=========================

Breaking changes
----------------

- Using a contract as part of a static type annotation will in most cases fail
  with an appropriate error message. This is a temporary limitation in order to
  fix previously unsound behavior in the typechecker. This restriction will
  likely be lifted in the upcoming 0.3.x release. For more details, see issues
  [#701](https://github.com/tweag/nickel/issues/701) and
  [#724](https://github.com/tweag/nickel/issues/724)

Fixes
-----

- Fix unnecessarily restricted record contract for `record.update`
- Fix wrong interpretation of long interpolation-like sequences `%..%{` in strings
- Fix panic when evaluating a `switch` in specific cases
- Fix fields without definition being assigned to `null`, instead of just being
  marked as undefined

Language features
-----------------

- Merging null values together gives null, and merging empty lists together gives
  an empty list, instead of failing with `error: non mergeable terms`
- Add recursive let-bindings (`let rec`)
- Add type wildcards. Use `_` in place of a type to let the typechecker fill
  the gap. Example: `let foo : _ = array.all ((==) 2) [1,2,3]`
- Add `builtin.to_str` and `string.from` to convert generic values to a string
- Re-introduce an official syntax for enum types

Tooling
-------

- Add the `nickel pprint-ast` command to pretty print a parsed program (mostly
  debugging purpose)
- Add the `nickel doc` command to produce markdown documentation from the
  in-code `doc` metadata

Documentation
-------------

- Fix various typos and remove use of deprecated syntax in the user manual

Version 0.1  (2022-03-10)
=========================

First release! The main focus has been the design of the Nickel language itself.

Language features
-----------------

- Gradual type system with row types, polymorphism and type inference
- Contract system for data validation
- Merge system for recursive records that supports one level of overriding
- Metadata annotations (default values, documentation, etc.)
- Unified syntax for terms, types and contracts (RFC002)
- Record destructuring

Tooling
-------

- The main binary supports the following subcommands:
  - `nickel query` to show metadata and documentation of library functions,
     the field of a configuration, etc.
  - `nickel export` to serialize to JSON, YAML, or TOML
  - `nickel repl` to launch an REPL
  - `nickel typecheck` to do typechecking without evaluating

- An LSP-server is included

Documentation
-------------

- User manual sections on syntax, correctness (types and contracts), and
  merging
- The standard library has been documented in-code (use
     `nickel query`/`:query` to retrieve it)

Known limitations
-----------------

- The roadmap for overriding and the merge system (RFC001) has not been
  implemented fully yet.

- Performance has not been prioritized.

- Due to the use of reference counting as a memory management strategy,
  mutually recursive record fields are currently leaking memory. This
  shouldn't be an issue in a standard workflow.

- Standard library APIs and language features are subject to change. There
  is no backward compatibility guarantees for this version. In general, this
  release is meant for experimenting and getting user feedback, but isn't
  intended to be used in production.
