  = This error may happen in the following situation:
        1. A function `f` is bound by a contract: e.g. `Bool -> Number`.
        2. `f` returns a value of the wrong type: e.g. `f = fun c => "string"` while `Number` is expected.
  = Either change the contract accordingly, or change the return value of `f`
