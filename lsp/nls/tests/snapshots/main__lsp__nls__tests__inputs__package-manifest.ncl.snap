[package (PackageId) [The dependency's identifier within the package index, in the format "github:<organization>/<repository>".], version (SemverReq) [The required version of the package.

Nickel supports two kinds of requirements: semver-compatible
requirements and exact version requirements. Semver-compatible
requirements take the form "major.minor.patch", where minor and patch
are optional. Their semantics are:

- "1.2.3" will match all versions having major version 1, minor version 2,
  and patch version at least 3.
- "1.2" will match all versions having major version 1 and minor version
  at least 2.
- "1" will match all versions having major version 1.
- a semver-compatible requirement will never match a prerelease version.

Exact version requirements take the form "=major.minor.patch-pre", where
the prerelease tag is optional, but major, minor, and patch are all required.]]
