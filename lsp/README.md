# Nickel Language Server

The Nickel Language Server (NLS) is a [language
server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol) for the
[Nickel](https://www.nickel-lang.org/) programming language. NLS offers error
messages, type hints, and auto-completion right in your favorite LSP-enabled
editor.

NLS is a stand-alone binary. Once built, you must then configure you code editor
to use it for Nickel source files. This document covers building NLS and using
it in VSCode and (Neo)Vim.

## Installation

Three installation methods are proposed: using Nix flakes (**recommended**),
using Nix without flakes (older Nix versions), or using `cargo` if you already
use the Rust toolchain and don't want to install Nix.

### Using Nix (flakes)

The easiest way to install `nls` is using [Nix](https://nixos.org/).

**Important**: the following of this section assumes that you have a flake-enabled
Nix (>= 2.4) and the experimental features `flakes` and `nix-command` enabled.
At the time of writing, the current stable version of Nix is flake-enabled. If
you haven't enabled any experimental feature globally or don't know what it is
even about, just append `--experimental-features "flakes nix-command"` to all of
the following commands.

- *Global installation*: if you want to use `nls` on a regular basis, this is
  what you want to do. To have `nickel` and `nls` available globally, add them
  into your profile:

    ```console
    nix profile install github:tweag/nickel
    ```

- *Shell*: Try out for the time of a session. To be dropped in a shell with the
  `nickel` and `nls` commands available, run:

    ```console
    nix shell github:tweag/nickel
    ```

- *Local build*: if you just wand to build `nickel`
  and `nls` without installing them (the executables will be placed in
  ./result/bin/):

    ```shell
    nix build github:tweag/nickel
    ```

### Using Nix (without flakes)

Alternatively, you can install `nickel` and `nls` globally on older Nix versions
without flakes via `nix-env`:

```console
git clone https://github.com/tweag/nickel.git
cd nickel
nix-env -f . -i
```

### Using Cargo

If you already have a working [`cargo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/)
installation, you can make `nls` available globally without Nix:

```console
cargo install nickel-lang-lsp
```

**WARNING**: the 0.1.0 version of the NLS crate
([nickel-lang-lsp](https://crates.io/crates/nickel-lang-lsp)) doesn't
correctly define the name of the binary as `nls`. If you can't find `nls` after
a successful cargo installation, try to run `nickel-lang-lsp --version`. If this
command is available, you'll have to substitute `nls` for `nickel-lang-lsp` in
the instructions that follow.

## Interfacing with editors

Once the `nls` binary is available, you can proceed with the configuration of
your editor.

### VS Code

#### Build the extension

NLS is currently not available through the vscode marketplace, but this
repository includes an extension that can be built locally via Nix (see the
section about the Nix setup).

- One-liner (using the [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) command):

  ```console
  code --install-extension $(nix build ./\#vscodeExtension --no-link --json | jq ".[0].outputs.vsix")
  ```

- In two steps, going via VSCode:
  - Build with Nix:

      ```console
      nix build github:tweag/nickel#vscodeExtension
      ```

  - Then, in VSCode, use "Extension: Install from VSIX" in the vscode command
    palette and choose `./result-vsix/nls-client.vsix`.

#### Configuration

The VS Code extension offers three configuration options:

- `nls.server.path`: Path to nickel language server
- `nls.server.trace`: Enables performance tracing to the given file
- `nls.server.debugLog`: Logs the communication between VS Code and the language
  server.

### (Neo)Vim

Before proceeding install the [Nickel syntax highlighting
plugin](https://github.com/nickel-lang/vim-nickel) using your Vim plugin
manager. Without this plugin your LSP client may not start NLS on nickel source
files.

With Vim-Plug:

```vim
Plug 'nickel-lang/vim-nickel'
```

#### Neovim builtin LSP

`nls` is supported in
[nvim-lspconfig](https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig). Using
`nvim-lspconfig` setup `nls` like all your other LSP servers as described by the
`nvim-lspconfig` ReadMe.

```lua
require('lspconfig')["nickel_ls"].setup {}
```

#### With Coc.nvim

Add an `nickel_ls` entry to your configuration. Type `:CocConfig` in Neovim (or
edit `coc-settings.json`) and add:

```jsonc
{
  "languageserver": {
    // Your other language servers configuration
    // ...,
    "nickel_ls": {
      "command": "nls",
      // You can enable performance tracing with:
      // "command": "nls --trace <file>",
      "rootPatterns": [
        ".git"
      ],
      "filetypes": [
        "ncl"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
