/// # Revertible thunks
///
/// Recursive records are better understood as being functions. For example, the recursive record:
///
/// ```nickel
/// {
///   foo = bar + baz + 1,
///   bar = 2,
///   baz = 1,
/// }
/// ```
///
/// is really a builtin representation of `fun self => {foo = self.bar + self.baz + 1, bar = 2, baz
/// = 1}`. The interpreter computes a fixpoint when evaluating a `RecRecord` away to a `Record`,
/// equivalent to `let rec fixpoint = repr fixpoint in fixpoint`. We use a different vocabulary and
/// representation, but this is what we essentially do. We're just hiding the details from the
/// user and pretend recursive records are data that can be used as a normal record, because it's
/// both simple and natural (for the user).
///
/// A naive representation of recursive records could be to always keep recursive records in their
/// functional representation, and re-compute the fixpoint at each record operation, such as field
/// access. While correct, this would be wasteful, because the result of the fixpoint computations
/// is actually the same throughout most record operations (put differently, `self` doesn't
/// change). But we can't just store the computed `fixpoint` in a normal thunk and forget
/// about the original function, because upon merge, and more specifically upon recursive
/// overriding, we do need to compute a new fixpoint.
///
/// Revertible thunks are a **memoization device** for the `fun self => ...` functional
/// representation of a recursive record. First, note that there are several different but
/// equivalent ways of encoding the example above as a function:
///
/// ```nickel
/// fun self => { foo = self.bar + self.baz + 1, bar = 2, baz = 1 }
///
/// # pushing the function down the fields
/// {foo = fun self => self.bar + self.baz + 1, bar = fun self => 2, baz = fun self => 1}
///
/// # removing unused arguments
/// {foo = fun self => self.bar + self.baz + 1, bar = 2, baz = 1}
///
/// # splitting the self argument
/// {foo = fun bar baz => bar + baz + 1, bar = 2, bar 1}
/// ```
///
/// All those representations are isomorphic, in that, modulo basic free variable analysis, we can
/// get from one to another mechanically. Pushing the functions down the fields is better because
/// it reveals more static information about the record (such as the list of fields) without having
/// to provide any argument first. Then, splitting `self` and removing the function altogether when
/// the field doesn't depend on other fields is more precise with respect to dependency tracking
/// (this has an important positive memory impact, see [crate::term::FieldDeps]).
///
/// In practice, Nickel uses the last representation. Fields that don't have any free variable
/// intersecting with the name of the other fields are allocated as normal thunks that will only be
/// evaluated at most once. Fields with actual dependencies are stored in revertible thunks, where
/// the `orig` field stores the body of the function (in our example the expression `bar + baz +
/// 1`), and the cached version is the application to `self` computed when we evaluated the
/// recursive record to a normal record. The function arguments (that is, the intersection of the
/// free variables of the expression with the set of fields) are stored inside `deps`. `deps`
/// represent the other fields a specific field is depending on, and are guaranteed to appear free
/// inside `orig`.
///
/// In fact, unless there is an unbound identifier, `deps` should be exactly the set of free
/// variables of `orig`.
