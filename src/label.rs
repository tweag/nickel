    //! Checking higher-order contracts can involve a good share of intermediate contract checking.
    //! Take the following example:
    //! ```text
    //! Assume((Number -> Number) -> Number) -> Number -> Number, fun ev => fun cst => ev (fun x => cst))
    //! ```
    //! Once called, various checks will be performed on the arguments of functions and their return
    //! values:
    //! 1. Check that `ev` provides a `Number` to `(fun x => cst)`
    //! 2. Check that `(fun x => cst)` returns a `Number`
    //! 3. Check that `ev (fun x => cst)` return a `Number`
    //! 4. etc.
    //!
    //! Each check can be linked to a base type occurrence (here, a `Number`) in the original type:
    //! ```text
    //! (Number -> Number) -> Number) -> Number -> Number
    //!  ^^^^^1    ^^^^^^2    ^^^^^^3    etc.
    //! ```
    //!
    //! This is the information encoded by a type path: what part of the original type is currently
    //! being checked by this label. It is then reported to the user in case of a blame.
    //!
    //! Paths are encoded as lists of elements, specifying if the next step is either to go to the **domain**
    //! or to the **codomain**.
    //!
    //! When reporting a blame error on a record type, one faces the same situation as with
    //! higher-order functions: the precise cause of an error can correspond to a small subtype of
    //! the original record type. Type path elements can thus also consist of a record field,
    //! indicating that the path leading to the subtype of interest goes through a record via a
    //! particular field.

///
/// # Polarity
///
/// One crucial aspect of first class contracts is to be able to check higher-order types, which
/// are types with arrows in it. Consider the simplest example:
///
/// ```text
/// f | Number -> Number
/// ```
///
/// This does not entail that `f` returns a `Number` in *every* situation. The identity function
/// `id = fun x => x` can certainly be given the type `Number -> Number`, but `id "a" = "a"` is not
/// a `Number`.
///
/// To satisfy the contract `Number -> Number` for `f` is to satisfy the predicate "if you give me
/// a `Number` as an argument, I give you a `Number` as a result". There is an additional contract
/// to be checked, which is not the responsibility of `f`, but the caller's (or context) one.
///
/// `f | Number -> Number` should thus be evaluated as `fun arg => ((f (arg | Number)) | Number)`,
/// but we want to report the failures of the two introduced subcontracts in a different way:
///
///  - The inner one (on the argument) says that `f` has been misused: it has been applied to
///  something that is not a `Number`.
///  - The outer one says that `f` failed to satisfy its contract, as it has been provided with a
///  `Number` (otherwise the inner contracts would have failed before) but failed to deliver a
///  `Number`.
///
/// This duality caller/callee or function/context is indicated by the polarity: the outer
/// corresponds to a *positive* polarity (the contract is on the term), while the inner corresponds
/// to a *negative* one (the contact is on the context). The polarity always starts as `true` in
/// user-written contracts, but is toggled in the argument contract when the interpreter decomposes
/// an higher order-contract. This also generalizes to higher types such as `((Number -> Number) ->
/// Number) -> Number` where the polarity alternates each time.
