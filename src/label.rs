    //! Checking higher-order contracts can involve a good share of intermediate contract checking.
    //! Take the following example:
    //! ```text
    //! Assume((Num -> Num) -> Num) -> Num -> Num, fun ev => fun cst => ev (fun x => cst))
    //! ```
    //! Once called, various checks will be performed on the arguments of functions and their return
    //! values:
    //! 1. Check that `ev` provides a `Num` to `(fun x => cst)`
    //! 2. Check that `(fun x => cst)` returns a `Num`
    //! 3. Check that `ev (fun x => cst)` return a `Num`
    //! 4. etc.
    //!
    //! Each check can be linked to a base type occurrence (here, a `Num`) in the original type:
    //! ```text
    //! (Num -> Num) -> Num) -> Num -> Num
    //!  ^^^1   ^^^2    ^^^3    etc.
    //! ```
    //!
    //! This is the information encoded by a type path: what part of the original type is currently
    //! being checked by this label. It is then reported to the user in case of a blame.
    //!
    //! Paths are encoded as lists of elements, specifying if the next step is either to go to the **domain**
    //! or to the **codomain**.
    //!
    //! When reporting a blame error on a record type, one faces the same situation as with
    //! higher-order functions: the precise cause of an error can correspond to a small subtype of
    //! the original record type. Type path elements can thus also consist of a record field,
    //! indicating that the path leading to the subtype of interest goes through a record via a
    //! particular field.

/// A blame label.
///
/// A label is associated to a contract check (an assume, a promise or a contract as an enriched
/// value) and contains information to report to the user when a contract fails and a blame occurs.
/// It includes in particular a [type path][ty_path::Path] and a **polarity**.
///
/// # Polarity
///
/// One crucial aspect of first class contracts is to be able to check higher-order types, which
/// are types with arrows in it. Consider the simplest example:
///
/// ```text
/// Assume(Num -> Num, f)
/// ```
///
/// This does not entail that `f` returns a `Num` in *every* situation. The identity function `id
/// = fun x => x` can certainly be given the type `Num -> Num`, but `id "a" = "a"` is not a `Num`.
///
/// To satisfy the contract `Num -> Num` for `f` is to satisfy the predicate "if you give me a
/// `Num` as an argument, I give you a `Num` as a result". There is an additional contract to be
/// checked, which is not the responsibility of `f`, but the caller's (or context)
/// one.
///
/// `Assume(Num -> Num, f)` should thus be evaluated as `Assume(Num, fun arg
/// => f (Assume(Num, arg)))`, but we want to report the failures of the two introduced
/// subcontracts in a different way:
///  - The inner one (on the argument) says that `f` has been misused: it has been applied to
///  something that is not a `Num`.
///  - The outer one says that `f` failed to satisfy its contract, as it has been provided with a
///  `Num` (otherwise the inner contracts would have failed before) but failed to deliver a `Num`.
///
/// This duality caller/callee or function/context is indicated by the polarity: the outer
/// corresponds to a *positive* polarity (the contract is on the term), while the inner corresponds
/// to a *negative* one (the contact is on the context). The polarity always starts as `true` in
/// user-written contracts, but is toggled in the argument contract when the interpreter decomposes
/// an higher order-contract. This also generalizes to higher types such as `((Num -> Num) -> Num)
/// -> Num` where the polarity alternates each time.
