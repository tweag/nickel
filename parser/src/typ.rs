//! Nickel static types.
//!
//! The type system of Nickel is comprised of primitive types, arrays, records, functions, and
//! opaque types (contracts). This is a structural type system with row polymorphism for both
//! records and enums.
//!
//! ## Record types (rows)
//!
//! A row type for a record is represented as a linked list of pairs `(id, type)` indicating the
//! name and the type of each field. Row-polymorphism means that the tail of this list can be a
//! type variable which can be abstracted over, leaving the row open for future extension. A simple
//! illustration is record field access:
//!
//! ```nickel
//! let f : forall a. { some_field : Number; a} -> Number =
//!   fun record => record.some_field
//! ```
//!
//! The type `{ some_field: Number; a }` indicates that an argument to this function must have at
//! least the field `some_field` of type `Number`, but may contain other fields (or not).
//!
//! ## Dictionaries
//!
//! A dictionary type `{ _ : Type }` represents a record whose fields all have the type `Type`. The
//! count and the name of the fields aren't constrained. Dictionaries can be mapped over, extended,
//! shrinked and accessed in a type-safe manner.
//!
//! # Enum types
//!
//! An enum type is also a row type where each element is a tag, such as `[| 'foo, 'bar, 'baz |]`.
//! This type represent values that can be either `'foo`, `'bar` or `'baz`. Enums support row
//! polymorphism as well.
//!
//! # Contracts
//!
//! To each type corresponds a contract, which is equivalent to a Nickel function which checks at
//! runtime that its argument is of the given type. Contract checks are introduced by a contract
//! annotation or propagated via merging. They ensure sane interaction between typed and untyped
//! parts.
//!
//! Conversely, any Nickel term seen as a contract corresponds to a type, which is opaque and can
//! only be equated with itself.

/// # Generic representation (functor)
///
/// A Nickel type is represented by a tree and is naturally defined in a recursive manner: for
/// example, one would expect the constructor for function types (`Arrow`) to look like:
///
/// ```rust
/// pub enum Type {
///      Arrow(Box<Type>, Box<Type>),
///      // ...
/// }
/// ```
///
/// However, `TypeF` is slightly different, in that it is parametrized by a generic type instead of
/// using a concrete definition like `Box<Types>` (forget about rows for now):
///
/// ```rust
/// pub enum TypeF<Ty /* , .. */> {
///      Arrow(Ty, Ty),
///      // ...
/// }
/// ```
///
/// `Ty` is also called a recursive unfolding throughout the documentation. By defining `struct
/// Type(TypeF<Box<Types>>)`, we get back the original, natural definition.
///
/// ## Motivation 1: variation on `Types`
///
/// Having a generic definition makes it possible to easily create other types with the _same shape_
/// as `Type` (seen as trees), but with enriched nodes. The typical use-case in Nickel is the
/// variation on types used by the typechecker. During type inference, the typechecker operates on
/// trees where each node can either be a concrete type, or a unification variable (a unknown type
/// to be inferred). Instead of duplicating the whole definition of `Type` as well as all basic
/// methods, we can simply have a different recursive definition:
///
/// ```
/// # // phony declarations to make this example pass the tests
/// # type VarId = ();
/// # type TypeF<T> = T;
///
/// pub enum UnifType {
///    UnifVar(VarId),
///    Concrete(TypeF<Box<UnifType> /*, .. */>),
///    // ..
///  }
/// ```
///
/// We get something that looks like normal Nickel types, except that each node can also be a
/// unification variable as well.
///
/// ## Motivation 2: recursion schemes
///
/// This definition is actually in the style of recursion schemes. Pedantically, `TypeF` (hence the
/// `F` suffix) is a functor, but the formal details aren't so important: keep in mind that the `F`
/// suffix means that the recursive occurrences of subtrees (and enum rows and record rows as well)
/// are replaced by generic parameters.
///
/// The usual motivation for recursion schemes is that they allow for elegant and simple definitions
/// of recursive transformation over trees (here, `TypeF`, and more generally anything with an `F`
/// suffix) in terms of simple appropriate chaining of `map` and folding/unfolding operations. A
/// good example is the definition of [Type::traverse]. Although [crate::term::Term] isn't currently
/// defined using functors per se, the way program transformations are written is in the same style
/// as recursion schemes: we simply define the action of a transformation as a mapping on the
/// current node, and let the traversal take care of the plumbing of recursion and reconstruction.
///
/// ## Type parameters
